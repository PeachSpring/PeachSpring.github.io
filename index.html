<p>Abstract</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Introduction of League Of Legends World Championship and some stories about it. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="1-Brief"><a href="#1-Brief" class="headerlink" title="1. Brief"></a>1. Brief</h2><p>​	League of Legends so-called LOL is a famous MOBA game which is developed by Riot Games. It has lots of players all over the world and I’m one of them. And the League Of Legends World Championship is the most magnificent annual competition for this game. It generally begins at October or November and lasts for about two months. From 2011 (S1) to 2022 (S12), during the 12 years it has held 12 sessions. And it is still the the gold standard of LOL competitions and has lots of audiences like 5.14 million this year.</p>
<h3 id="1-1-Participating-Teams"><a href="#1-1-Participating-Teams" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Participating Teams"></a>1.1 Participating Teams</h3><p>​	The competition oﬀicial divided the world into different gaming regions, such as LPL for China, LCK for South Korea, LEC for Europe and so on. Every year some of the powerful teams will go to the competition representing each own regions. Every region’s number of teams which can go to the competition depends on its region’s total strength. Like powerful South Korean LCK has four quotas but relatively weak Vietnam VCS only has one quotas. Finally, there are 24 teams participating games.</p>
<h3 id="1-2-Competition-Process-Competition-Process"><a href="#1-2-Competition-Process-Competition-Process" class="headerlink" title="1.2  Competition Process Competition Process"></a>1.2  Competition Process Competition Process</h3><p>​	The competition consists of three rounds, play-in round, group round and knockout round. In the play-in round, the last 10 teams in all 24 teams will be randomly grouped into two groups and each fight once with the other 4 teams which are in the same group. Finally each group’s highest scored team can continue going into group round. It also means there are only two teams can win the play-in round from all 10 teams and go to group round. Following there are 16 teams in the group round, and they will be grouped into 4 groups and fight with each which in the same group other twice. Then each group’s first and second scored team can go to the knockout round. Finally there are 8 teams in the knockout round. In this round, group first team will randomly matches other group’s second team. Each round there will be half teams be knocked out by ”three wins in five games” so-called ”Bo5” till there is only one team. The last team is the champion the five members can hold their trophy.</p>
<h2 id="2-Regret-and-Perseverance"><a href="#2-Regret-and-Perseverance" class="headerlink" title="2. Regret and Perseverance"></a>2. Regret and Perseverance</h2><p>​	I have played LOL and concerned League Of Legends World Championship for seven years. The final this year impressed me most. This year DRX and T1 meet in the final which both teams are from South Korea. The Regret and Perseverance story just happened between this two teams.</p>
<p>​	Faker, a member of T1, is a really Legendary player. He began his professional LOL e-sports player career since 2013 and still play today. In his career, he has won three times champion in the world final. No one has ever broken his record to date. He is 27 years old now, most players can only work for about 3 or 4 years in e-sports sector and then quit due to the ability decrease following the growing age. But Faker plays for 10 years and still keep his ability, this thing is totally a legend.</p>
<p>​	The another main character in this story is DRX team’s member, Deft. Like Faker, Deft is also rare player who has played for ten years. However, what different is that Deft has never won a championship in world final. Like all the players, there is only target in Deft’s career, getting championship in world final. He insist for the target for ten years. Unfortunately, this year is his “last dance” because he is really old as a e-sports player. If he don’t win finally, he will retire with regret which last for ten years.</p>
<p>​	So Faker who used win three times championship but had not won championship since 2016 and Deft who has fight for ten years without championship, these two players become spotlights of this year’s world final. They both persever for a long time for the last championship before they retire.</p>
<p><img src="https://gcore.jsdelivr.net/gh/tbbbk/BlogIMG/DRX.png"></p>
<p>​	Finally, after five tense and exciting matchups, DRX won by 3:2, which means Deft achieves his ten years dream. Deft’s perseverance for ten years pay back. When saw Deft celebrating with his teammates in a happy embrace, lifting the trophy together with tears streaming down his face, I experience the charm of e-sports again. But Faker leaves stage without speaking anything. E-sports is cruel, there is only one championship. His regret continues. I hope he can continue insisting till get his last championship and make the legend going on.</p>
<p>​	Legends Never Die is the name of 2017 League Of Legends World Championship’s theme song, I think it’s fit to be this passage’s title and my wish to Faker’s furture.</p>
<h2 id="3-My-Notes"><a href="#3-My-Notes" class="headerlink" title="3. My Notes"></a>3. My Notes</h2><h3 id="3-1-In-Preparation"><a href="#3-1-In-Preparation" class="headerlink" title="3.1 In Preparation"></a>3.1 In Preparation</h3><p>​	At first I don’t what to write, I waste few days to think the theme. Then I notice that the paper requirement has “a topic that has less connection to your studies but is something that interests you”. So I prepare to write about the LOL competition. I have lots to write about it, so actually there isn’t lots of preparation and I write the paper very fluently :)</p>
<h3 id="3-2-In-Organization"><a href="#3-2-In-Organization" class="headerlink" title="3.2 In Organization"></a>3.2 In Organization</h3><p>​	When I was writing the Regret and Perseverance part, I once thought about write Regret and Perseverance separtely. But then I realized that why people regret is regret just due to the long time perseverance. So finally I decided to write them together.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.lamost.org/public/?locale=en">LAMOST</a> is a new type of large field of view and large aperture telescope. It was developed by Chinese scientific academy   and established in 2012. “LAMOST” is comes from a Chinese ancient scientist, Guo Shoujing  who had made great achievement in astronomy. The “huge” telescope has ran for ten years and published about 20 millions spectral data.</p>
<p>LAMOST has make a contribution for international astronomical career. It achieved the breakthrough of combining a large field of view and a large aperture in an optical telescope. At the same time it has specifical download system which provide the way to download data for common person.</p>
<p>But there are lots of arguments about it. Some people would say “the LAMOST is a failed project.” Because it doesn’t achieve the origin purpose like the almost complete failure of project of patrolling the universe. But some people still recognize it due to it’s breakthrough in the field of large aperture telescope. It’s hard to judge it, so I just reserve my opinion.</p>

<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>It</strong> has been shown by Bothe and others that beryllium when bombarded by α-particles of polonium emits a radiation of great penetrating power, which has been an absorption coefficient in lead of about 0.3 (cm)^-1.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>I</strong> have made some experiments using the valve counter to examine the properties of this radiation excited in beryllium. </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>If</strong> we ascribe the ejection of the proton to a Compton recoil from a quantum of 52 x 10^6 electron volts, then the nitrogen recoil atom arising by a similar process should have an energy not greater than about 400,000 volts, should produce not more than about 10,000 ions, and have a range in air at N.T.P. of about 1.3 mm.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>These</strong> results, and others I have obtained in the course of the work, are very difficult to explain on the assumption that the radiation from beryllium is a quantum radiation, if energy and momentum are to be conserved in the collisions.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>If</strong> it be supposed that the radiation consists of quanta, then the capture of the α-particle by the Be^9 nucleus will form a C^13 nucleus. </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p><strong>It</strong> is to be expected that many of the effects of a neutron in passing through matter should resemble those of a quantum of high energy, and it is not easy to reach the final decision between the two hypotheses.</p>

<li><strong>I</strong> guess Chadwick made some experiments about what mentioned above.</li>

<p><strong>Looking Back</strong> is an caricature painted by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://app.moegirl.org.cn/error-pages/503.html">藤本樹</a>. It’s about two girls’ story about their love for painting caricature. I’m an avid fan of 藤本樹 for his caricature and this is the first entity book I bought though I have liked him for many years.</p>
<p>This picture shows the heroine’s normal life. She always draws from spring to the next spring. In this picture, the heroine’s position is fixed the room settings can tell the time is flowing. Actually it’s so normal in 藤本樹’s work, he always express his idea by details which can convey the idea “silently”.</p>
<p> 藤本樹 is a weird person, he is always called neuropathy by his fans. But “neuropathy” contains no hate. His anime is rambled but interesting and beautiful all the time. This can’t be showed by words, I sincerely commend you to read his caricature.</p>
